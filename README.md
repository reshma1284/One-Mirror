# One-Mirror 


### Description
At the end of the guide period we made a project for Restart/Network.

The goal is to have a platform that contains all the students information that will be used to send to companies interested in students from the One-Program. 

## The main functionalities include:-

* Students can login and view their information and their progress within the One-Program as well as they can access their linkedin, github, slack etc through the portal. 
* Students can raise a change request to have their information edited.
* Admin can add new batches and also have the access to add , edit and delete student details from the system. 
* Admin can also approve the change request made by the student so that it gets reflected in the system

# Build On:
* Node.JS
* Express
* React.JS
* MongoDB
